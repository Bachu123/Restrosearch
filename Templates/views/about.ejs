            <p>Positive section of review

                Good location on the beach front. The concierge staff were awesome. Has good views from the rooftop with its small pool with swim up bar. The room and bed were large and comfortable.

                I probably had the worst meal I have had in Latin America at the hotel restaurant. Iâ€™m not fussy and everything was atrocious. It must have been new staff!</p>

              <p>The breakfast was good but with a waiting line that I didn't like but I understand for the value for money hotel it is...with lots of people. You can sit by the pool drinking your own beers. When you see the price of beers/food etc in buzios you will appreciate that. Close to all the places you want to visit and can hire a buggy next-door!</p>
